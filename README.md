## Introduction

In the realm of cybersecurity, staying one step ahead of potential threats is essential. Honeypots are a proactive approach that allows security professionals to observe and analyze the tactics of potential attackers. This project leverages Azure cloud services to create a honeypot, collect valuable data through logs, and visualize the global landscape of potential threats.

## Project Components

- **Azure Virtual Machine (Honeypot):** A specially configured Azure virtual machine serves as the honeypot, designed to attract and interact with potential attackers.

- **Azure Log Analytics Workspace:** Logs generated by the honeypot are stored and analyzed in an Azure Log Analytics workspace. Data collection rules are set up to capture essential information.

- **Azure Monitor:** Azure Monitor ensures the health and performance of the honeypot virtual machine are continually tracked. Alert rules notify you of critical events.

- **IP Geolocation API:** An IP geolocation API is used to capture IP addresses of potential attackers. This information is invaluable for identifying the origin of potential threats.

- **PowerShell Script:** A custom PowerShell script queries the IP geolocation API, extracts geolocation data, and formats it for integration into Azure Log Analytics.

- **Kusto Query Language (KQL):** KQL queries are used to parse and analyze the collected log data, enriching it with geolocation information.

- **Azure Sentinel:** Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's SIEM solution, is set up to ingest and visualize the parsed log data. Custom dashboards and threat maps provide valuable insights into potential threats.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Deploy a secure Azure honeypot virtual machine.
- Centralize and analyze logs using Azure Log Analytics.
- Monitor the virtual machine's health with Azure Monitor.
- Enrich log data with geolocation information from an IP Geolocation API.
- Develop a PowerShell script for geolocation data extraction.
- Utilize KQL queries to gain insights from log data.
- Create threat maps and visualizations using Azure Sentinel.
